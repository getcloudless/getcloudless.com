Core Principle: Users Need To Experiment
- This is with the SSH key idea.  The point here is that the user must be able to easily spin up an instance, SSH in and play around to get it working, and then take what they did back to their workflow.  I can add stuff here that makes it easy to rerun scripts from the local machine.  Maybe it could even reset the user-data.  Let's not get crazy (also that's AWS specific).
