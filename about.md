## Cloudless

Cloudless is a tool for interacting with cloud services in a straightforward,
but still powerful way.  It's intended for teams that want to deploy their own
services, but still don't want to have to go through the pain of setting
everything up themselves.

Read the [Welcome to Cloudless]({% post_url 2018-09-05-welcome-to-cloudless %})
blog post for a good introduction to what Cloudless is and why it exists.

See the [Documentation](https://docs.getcloudless.com/) for how to get started,
and follow along with the [Github
Repo](https://github.com/getcloudless/cloudless) to stay up to date on current
development.

You can also send an email to [info@getcloudless.com](info@getcloudless.com) or
[subscribe](/#subscribe-for-updates) to stay in touch.

**Shaun Verch (Founder and CEO)**

Hi I'm Shaun (sverch)!

I'm a Site Reliability Engineer who has built cloud infrastructure in a wide
range of organizations: from a 15 person startup to the world's largest
employer.  I started Cloudless in 2018 to make it harder for humans to make
harmful mistakes in software.  I'm passionate about open source and about making
it easier for people to develop robust, cloud agnostic infrastructure solutions.
Please [reach out](mailto:info@getcloudless.com) if you would like to join or
contribute to Cloudless!
