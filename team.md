**Shaun Verch (Founder)**

Hi, I'm [@sverch](https://github.com/sverch)!  I'm a Site Reliability Engineer
who has built cloud infrastructure in a wide range of organizations: from a 15
person startup to the world's largest employer.  I started Cloudless in 2018 to
make it harder for humans to make harmful mistakes in software.  I'm passionate
about open source and about making it easier for people to develop robust, cloud
agnostic infrastructure solutions.

Hi, I'm [@jankyswanky](https://github.com/jankyswanky)!  I'm a Product Manager
and data nerd who's launched 3 successful products from the ground up, which are
used by ~6.75 million people. I'm good with data, teasing out user problems, and
asking lots of questions. I joined Cloudless because I have a passion for open
source and making it easier for people to build things that help other people.
