Welcome to Cloudless!  Cloudless is an open source cloud deployment tool
designed to make it as easy to deploy your own infrastructure stack as it is to
buy a black box managed service.

Why use Cloudless?  Cloudless is...

{% include intro-grid.html
    section_1_header="Intuitive"
    section_1_content="Cloudless does the right thing and makes it obvious why.
    At its core, it creates and connects virtual machines in private networks.
    That's all there is to it."

    section_2_header="Lightweight"
    section_2_content="No framework or extra infrastructure necessary.  The
    library and command line interface interact directly with the cloud
    provider."

    section_3_header="Flexible"
    section_3_content="Cloudless has no opinions on what you install on your
    servers, so you can use any configuration management tool you choose, or
    just use Cloudless on its own."

    section_4_header="Portable"
    section_4_content="Because instance types, feature names, and specific
    property names are all abstracted away, any infrastructure built using
    Cloudless works across all supported providers." %}

**Shaun Verch (Founder)**

Hi, I'm [@sverch](https://github.com/sverch)!  I'm a Site Reliability Engineer
who has built cloud infrastructure in a wide range of organizations: from a 15
person startup to the world's largest employer.  I started Cloudless in 2018 to
make it harder for humans to make harmful mistakes in software.  I'm passionate
about open source and about making it easier for people to develop robust, cloud
agnostic infrastructure solutions.
