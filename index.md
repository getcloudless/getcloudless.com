introduction: |
    Cloudless is a tool to abstract away many of the details that make working
    with the cloud slow, frustrating, and error prone.  It aims to do the right
    thing that is transparent to users, yet still be powerful and flexible
    enough that no one has to rearchitect their system to use it.

    See the [Documentation](https://docs.getcloudless.com/) for how to get
    started, follow along with the [Github
    Repo](https://github.com/getcloudless/cloudless) to stay up to date on
    current development, and finally, send an email to
    [info@getcloudless.com](info@getcloudless.com) or
    [subscribe below](/#subscribe-for-updates) to stay in touch.
