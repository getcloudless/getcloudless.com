introduction: |
    Cloudless is a tool to abstract away many of the details that make working
    with the cloud slow, frustrating, and error prone.  It aims to do the right
    thing that is transparent to users, yet still be powerful and flexible
    enough that no one has to rearchitect their system to use it.
